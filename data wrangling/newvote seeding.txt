use newvote-staging.rar to seed your DB
You will need to decompress the rar and run this command in the parent directory
mongorestore -h localhost -d newvote-uqu newvote-staging

User accounts:
admin@test.com

Note: you will want to modify your HOSTS file so that you can access the site at a regular URL
I have a line like this:
127.0.0.1 com1.localhost.newvote.org com2.localhost.newvote.org
