Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. Friends and money - oil and water. Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?</p>",
    "statements": "<p>My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? \"Oh, what do I do? What do I do?\" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull. I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here.</p>",

Never let anyone know what you are thinking. That's my family Kay, that's not me. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.</p>",

If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone.</p>",
